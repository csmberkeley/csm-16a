# Quick Tips on Modular Circuit Design
_________________________________________________________________________
By Paul Shao

When solving a circuit design question on the exam, sometimes it might be very hard to wrap your head around how to come up with a well-designed and fully functional circuits that fulfill all the requirements. However, a quick trick that you can use to at least get a head start on the problem or head in the general right direction is to extract **"keywords"** from the problem and mapping it to a **circuit component/configuration you already know**. This set up will usually do at least 50% of the design for you, while what is left normally is just to figure out how to connect them together.

The table below lists a general mapping between the **keywords** you see within the question(s) and the corresponding circuit elements:

| Keywords                                                                                                                                             	| Circuit Elements/Concepts                                                                                                                                                                	|
|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	|
| amplify voltage                                                                                                                                      	| **non-inverting op-amp**                                                                                                                                                                 	|
| invert/reverse voltage                                                                                                                               	| **inverting op-amp**                                                                                                                                                                     	|
| voltage/current change  based on a given  condition (such as  applying a force or a change in temperature)                                           	| **voltage divider** (usually  in this case the problem will provide you with a variable resistor that changes its resistance based on the given condition)                               	|
| output two different  voltages/currents based on a given condition (such as a changing the direction a bot is heading or turning a switch on or off) 	| **op-amp comparator** (be careful about what you feed into the V+ and V- parts of the  comparator; remember that  V+ is the input variable voltage, while V- is the  reference voltage)  	|
| maintains a buffer against a high input voltage/provides stability against variable signals                                                          	| **op-amp buffer**                                                                                                                                                                        	|
| provides a linear combination of the given voltages                                                                                                  	| KCL (consider how currents merge into one node as a sum of V/R's, essentially  voltages multiplied by scalars); for more references, you can  search up the term **"summing amplifier"** 	|
| provides the difference between  the given voltages                                                                                                  	| **differential amplifier** (a combination of inverting and non- inverting amplifier. Voltage divider feeding into V+, and inverting  amplifier with V- on top)                           	|
| accumulate voltages ->  store charges to be released in the next iteration / when a switch is turned on                                              	| connecting voltage source to a **capacitor** for storing charges to its full  capacitance                                                                                                	|
