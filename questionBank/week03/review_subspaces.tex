\paragraph{Definition: Vector Space/Subspace}

A \textit{vector space} $V$ is a set of elements that is
\begin{enumerate}
	\item closed under vector addition.\\
		$\forall \vec{v_1}, \vec{v_2} \in V$\\
		$\vec{v_1} + \vec{v_2} \in V$
	\item closed under scalar multiplication.\\
		$\forall \vec{v} \in V, \alpha\in\mathbb{R}$\\
		$\alpha\vec{v} \in V$
\end{enumerate}

An important implication of these two properties is that a vector space (or subspace) contains a zero vector.

For the sake of clarity and brevity, we won't formally describe the properties of vector addition (associative, commutative, additive identity, and additive inverse) and scalar multiplication (associative, multiplicative identity, distributive in vector addition, and distributive in scalar addition) upon which the above definition is based.

% An \textit{affine space} $W$ can be thought graphically of as a vector space offset by a vector $\vec{w}$ from the origin, and so does not obey the properties above.
