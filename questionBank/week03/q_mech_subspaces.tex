\qns{Subspaces}
Determine if the following describe subspaces.

\sol{
\begin{itemize}
	\item Emphasize the importance of \textit{generalization} when determining whether a given set is a subspace (and for proofs in general). It is crucial to show that the two properties above hold for \textit{all} vectors within the set, not just one or two numerical examples.
	\item Clarify the mathematical notation, e.g. $\forall$ means ``for all'' and $:$ means ``such that''. Vocalizing what you're writing down as you write it will help keep you from moving too quickly while clarifying any confusing notation. 
	\item Graphical intuition tends to help students who don't have a strong linear algebra background.
\end{itemize}}

\begin{enumerate}
\qitem\label{ques:nonnegative}{
	$\{\vec{x} = \begin{bmatrix}x_1 & \cdots & x_n\end{bmatrix}^T : x_i \geq 0$ $\forall i=1, \cdots, n\}$
}

\sol{
	Tell the students what this means graphically!
}

\ans{

	We proceed to test if the set is closed under vector addition and scalar multiplication. \\ 
	Let's check if this set is closed under vector addition and scalar multiplication.
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textit{Vector addition}: Let's consider two vectors $\vec{v}$ and $\vec{u}$, both in the set.
		\begin{align*}
			\vec{v} &\dot{=} \begin{bmatrix}v_1 & \cdots & v_n\end{bmatrix}^T\\
			\vec{u} &\dot{=} \begin{bmatrix}u_1 & \cdots & u_n\end{bmatrix}^T
		\end{align*}
		where $v_i, u_i \geq 0$ $\forall i=1, \cdots, n$, i.e. all the elements of $\vec{v}, \vec{u}$ are nonnegative. To see that $V$ is closed under vector addition, we need $\vec{v} + \vec{u}$ to be contained within the set as well.
		\begin{align*}
			\vec{v} + \vec{u} &= \begin{bmatrix}v_1 + u_1 & \cdots & v_n + u_n\end{bmatrix}^T
		\end{align*}
		Because $v_i, u_i \geq 0$, then $v_i + u_i \geq 0$, and so $\vec{v} + \vec{u}$ is closed under vector addition.

		\item \textit{Scalar multiplication}: Suppose we have a vector $\vec{v} \in V$ and a number $\alpha \in \mathbb{R}$. Notice that $\alpha$ can be negative!

		To prove something false, we need only come up with a counterexample; so without loss of generality, let's say $\alpha = -1$. This means $\alpha \vec{v} = -\vec{v} = \begin{bmatrix}-v_1 & \cdots & -v_n\end{bmatrix}^T$, which does \textit{not} necessarily have nonnegative entries! Thus, the set is not closed under scalar multiplication.
	\end{itemize}

	The set does not describe a vector subspace because it is not closed under scalar multiplication $\square$
}

\qitem\label{ques:trivial}{
	$\{\vec{0}\}$
}

\sol{
	When teaching this question to your students, make sure you mention the significance of a single-element set (the fact that $\vec{0}$ is the \textbf{only} vector in the set), which greatly simplifies the subspace test process.}

\ans{
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textit{Vector addition}: Since $\vec{0}$ is the only vector in this set, $\vec{0} + \vec{0} = \vec{0} \in V$.
		\item \textit{Scalar multiplication}: Since $a \cdot \vec{0} = \vec{0} \: \: \forall a \in \mathbb{R}$, we have that $a \cdot \vec{0} \in V$.
	\end{itemize}

	The set is closed under vector addition and scalar multiplication, and so it is a vector space! $\square$
}

\qitem\label{ques:twoVecs}{
	$\left\{\begin{bmatrix}1\\0\end{bmatrix}, \begin{bmatrix}0\\1\end{bmatrix}\right\}$
}

\sol{
	Emphasize the difference between a set containing 2 vectors and a set that is the \textbf{span} of 2 vectors. The former \textbf{only contains 2 vectors}, while the latter \textbf{contains all linear combinations of the 2 vectors}.}

\ans{
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textit{Vector addition}: We can see that 
			$$\begin{bmatrix}1\\0\end{bmatrix} + \begin{bmatrix}0\\1\end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}1\\1\end{bmatrix}$$
			which is not in the set of vectors.
		\item \textit{Scalar multiplication}: Taking either of the vectors and scaling them by $\alpha \neq 1$ returns a vector not in the set, and so it is not closed under scalar multiplication.
	\end{itemize}

	This is \textit{not} a vector subspace. $\square$
}

\qitem\label{ques:spanTwoVecs}{
	span$\left(\begin{bmatrix}1\\0\end{bmatrix}, \begin{bmatrix}0\\1\end{bmatrix}\right)$
}

\sol{
	Reiterate the distinction between a single vector (like what's seen in part \ref{ques:twoVecs}) and its span.}

\ans{
	By definition, the span of $N$ vectors is the set of the linear combinations of those $N$ vectors. For this problem, we can rewrite the set as:
	$$\left\{a\begin{bmatrix}1\\0\end{bmatrix} + b\begin{bmatrix}0\\1\end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}a\\b\end{bmatrix}: a, b \in \mathbb{R} \right\}$$

	With the new definition, we see that the span of this set is $\mathbb{R}^2$, which is a vector subspace. For the sake of completeness, however, we'll go through the standard tests:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textit{Vector addition}: Let's define the following $\vec{v_1}$ and $\vec{v_2}$, both in the set.
		\begin{align*}
			\vec{v_i} &= a_i\begin{bmatrix}1\\0\end{bmatrix} + b_i\begin{bmatrix}0\\1\end{bmatrix}, i=1, 2\\
			\vec{v_1} + \vec{v_2} &= \left(a_1\begin{bmatrix}1\\0\end{bmatrix} + b_1\begin{bmatrix}0\\1\end{bmatrix}\right) + \left(a_2\begin{bmatrix}1\\0\end{bmatrix} + b_2\begin{bmatrix}0\\1\end{bmatrix}\right)\\
				&= \left(a_1 + a_2\right)\begin{bmatrix}1\\0\end{bmatrix} + \left(b_1 + b_2\right)\begin{bmatrix}0\\1\end{bmatrix}\\
				&= a\begin{bmatrix}1\\0\end{bmatrix} + b\begin{bmatrix}0\\1\end{bmatrix}
		\end{align*}
		\item \textit{Scalar multiplication}:
		\begin{align*}
			\vec{v} &= a\begin{bmatrix}1\\0\end{bmatrix} + b\begin{bmatrix}0\\1\end{bmatrix}\\
			\alpha\vec{v} &= \alpha a\begin{bmatrix}1\\0\end{bmatrix} + \alpha b\begin{bmatrix}0\\1\end{bmatrix}\\
				&= \hat{a}\begin{bmatrix}1\\0\end{bmatrix} + \hat{b}\begin{bmatrix}0\\1\end{bmatrix}
		\end{align*}
	\end{itemize}

	Hence, the set is a vector subspace $\square$
}

\qitem{
	$\left\{\begin{bmatrix}x_1\\x_2\\x_3\end{bmatrix} \in \mathbb{R}^3 : x_1 + x_2 + x_3 = 1\right\}$
}

\sol{
	Make sure you pace out the thought process for solving this question as it will require a bit more analysis/insight. Again, emphasize the importance of applying the 2 standard tests.}

\ans{
	Rewrite solution to include the tests explicitly written out. Include graphical explanation as well (a plane that doesn't pass through the origin).

	Similar to the last question, we are not directly/explicitly given all the elements within the set. However, we know that the sum of all 3 entries in the vector must be equal to 1.  \\ 
	Here's the catch, the nature of this equation (the fact that the sum is constrained to a particular value) has already set a counterexample for the set to fail the subspace test. Suppose we have some vector $\vec{v}$ whose entries all sum of 1, if we multiply it by any real scalar $a$, the sum of the entries in the new vector will be $a$ instead of 1, which means $a\vec{v} \notin V$. Hence, the set fails the closed under scalar multiplication test. \\
	Therefore, this set is not a vector subspace. $\square$
