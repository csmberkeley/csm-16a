\qns{Automatic Gain Control}

\begin{enumerate}
\qitem\label{amp}{
	Design a circuit where $V_\text{out} = -10V_\text{in}$. You are allowed to use
	\begin{itemize}
		\item op amps: $\leq$1. You do not need to specify rail voltages for this subpart.
		\item resistors: as many as you want, so long as they have positive values
		\item capacitors: as many as you want
	\end{itemize}}

\empt{
	\vspace{1.5cm}
	\begin{circuitikz}
		\draw
		(0,0) to[short] ++(-1,0)
			to[sV,v_=$V_\text{in}$] ++(0,-2)
			node[ground] () {};
	\end{circuitikz}
	\vspace{1.5cm}}

\ans{
	This is one possible solution:
	\begin{center}
		\input{../../questionBank/week09/q_design_agc_figs/sol_amp}
	\end{center}}

\qitem\label{no_rail}{
	Your design was provided voltage rails at $5\si{\volt}$ and $-5\si{\volt}$, and that your input signal looks like so:
	\begin{center}
		\input{../../questionBank/week09/q_design_agc_figs/no_rail_input}
	\end{center}
	Will your signal be faithfully amplified when $V_\text{out} = -10V_\text{in}$? That is, will your op amp distort the output because of railing/clipping?}

\empt{\vspace{2cm}}

\ans{
	The signal will be faithfully amplified.

	Our output is going to be limited to $\pm 5\si{\volt}$, meaning that with an amplifier gain $\frac{V_\text{out}}{V_\text{in}} = 10$, we can have an input no larger than $0.5\si{\volt}$ in the positive or negative direction.}

\qitem\label{yes_rail}{
	Again, your design has voltage rails at $\pm 5\si{\volt}$. Your input signal now looks like so:
	\begin{center}
		\input{../../questionBank/week09/q_design_agc_figs/yes_rail_input}
	\end{center}
	With this input signal and $V_\text{out} = -10V_\text{in}$, will your amplifier  distort the output due to railing/clipping?}

\empt{\vspace{2cm}}

\ans{
	The output will experience railing. From the explanation for part \ref{no_rail}, we know our input can swing no further than $0.5\si{\volt}$, and in this case the swing is $1\si{\volt}$.}

\qitem\label{resistorDAC}{
	Design a circuit which can have a resistance $R$ when an input signal $\phi$ is high and a resistance $nR$ ($n > 1$) when $\phi$ is low. You have access to:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item ideal switches: as many as you want
		\item resistors with positive values: $\leq 2$
		\item the signal $\phi$ and its complement, $\overline{\phi}$
	\end{itemize}}

\empt{\vspace{4cm}}

\ans{
	One possible solution is to place the resistor in series and short it out when $\phi$ is high:
	\begin{center}
		\input{../../questionBank/week09/q_design_agc_figs/rDAC_series}
	\end{center}

	Another possible solution is to place the resistor in parallel and place a switch in series with it to close whenever $\phi$ is high. Remember that in parallel, the resistance decreases!
	\begin{center}
		\input{../../questionBank/week09/q_design_agc_figs/rDAC_parallel}
	\end{center}}

\qitem\label{vga}{
	Using your answer from parts \ref{amp} and \ref{resistorDAC}, design a circuit where
	$$V_\text{out} = \begin{cases}
						-5V_\text{in} & \phi = \text{high}\\
						-10V_\text{in} & \phi = \text{low}
					\end{cases}$$}
\empt{
	\vspace{2cm}

	\begin{circuitikz}

		(0,0) to[short] ++(-1,0)
			to[sV,v_=$V_\text{in}$] ++(0,-2)
			node[ground] () {};
	\end{circuitikz}
	\vspace{2cm}}

\ans{
	Using the symbol for a variable resistor,
	\begin{center}
		\input{../../questionBank/week09/q_design_agc_figs/sol_vga}
	\end{center}
	we can replace $R_\text{var}$ with our answer to part \ref{resistorDAC}.
}
% \qitem\label{positive_agc}{
% 	We know what we want, but how do we get the signal $\phi$? In the real world, we often have to generate this ourselves. You may assume your answer from part \ref{amp} works as intended. Design a circuit whose output $\phi_\text{high-side}$ has the following traits:
% 	$$\phi_\text{high-side} = \begin{cases}
% 				V_{DD} & V_\text{in} > 0.49\si{\volt}\\
% 				V_{SS} & V_\text{in} < 0.49\si{\volt}
% 			\end{cases}$$
% 	You may use:
% 	\begin{itemize}
% 		\item op amps: as many as you want
% 		\item ideal voltage source: $\leq 1$ not including the provided $\pm 5\si{\volt}$ rails
% 	\end{itemize}
% 	}

% 			to[sV,v_=$V_\text{in}$] ++(0,-2)
% 			node[ground] () {};
% 	\end{circuitikz}}

% \ans{}

\qitem\label{agc}{
	Now let's put it all together. Design a circuit which lowers the gain setting when the input swing exceeds $0.49\si{\volt}$ (we usually like to leave some wriggle room just in case). You may assume all feedback loops are infinitely fast.
	$$V_\text{out} = \begin{cases}
						-5V_\text{in} & |V_\text{in}| > 0.49\si{\volt}\\
						-10V_\text{in} & |V_\text{in}| < 0.49\si{\volt}
					\end{cases}$$
	You may use
	\begin{itemize}
		\item op amps: as many as you want
		\item switches: as many as you want
		\item resistors with positive values: as many as you want
		\item ideal voltage source: as many as you want, not including the provided rails $\pm 5\si{\volt}$
		\item a device which returns the maximum of its two inputs: $\leq 1$
		\begin{center}
			\begin{circuitikz}
				\draw (0,0) node[or port] (OR) {}
				(OR.in 1) node[anchor=east] () {$V_\text{in1}$}
				(OR.in 2) node[anchor=east] () {$V_\text{in2}$}
				(OR.out) node[anchor=west] () {$V_\text{max}$};
			\end{circuitikz}
		\end{center}
	\end{itemize}
	\textit{Hint: It may be helpful to consider the single-sided case when $V_\text{in} > 0.49\si{\volt}$ first, then only start worrying about the negative case $V_\text{in} < -0.49\si{\volt}$ afterward.}}

\sol{
	This may be a large jump for your students. If they're stumped, try prompting them in this order:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item What component generates a high or low voltage depending on which input is larger/smaller? (Almost like we're going to \textit{compare} the inputs)
		\item What would we do if we only wanted to change the gain setting when $V_\text{in} > 0.49\si{\volt}$ and not worry about the negative case?
		\item How about the negative-only case, i.e. when $V_\text{in} < -0.49\si{\volt}$?
		\item How can we combine these?
	\end{enumerate}}

\ans{
	One possible solution:
	\begin{center}
		\input{../../questionBank/week09/q_design_agc_figs/sol_agc}
	\end{center}
	Another possible solution has it where the input to the comparators are connected to $V_\text{in}$ and the comparator voltage references are $\pm0.49\si{\volt}$ instead. In real-world circuit design, it's usually easier to work with larger signals (which is a reason to put the comparator inputs at the output of the amplifier), but this often comes at the expense of delay (nonzero response time for the amplifier, etc.).
	\textcolor{red}{This solution needs some serious beefing: (1) do we need to add an intermediate subpart for the single-sided case? (2) Analysis of how the circuit works}}
