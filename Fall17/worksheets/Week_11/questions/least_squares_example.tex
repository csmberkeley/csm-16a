Description: Describe and derive the least squares problem and solution, first geometrically, and then using calculus.
}

\begin{enumerate}
\qitem{Consider the basic problem of finding some $\vec{x}$ such that $\mathbf{A}\vec{x} = \vec{b}$. If we have an equal number of equations as unknowns, then we are pretty happy.\\

In many cases, however, we cannot find a solution, as the set of equations that are described by $\mathbf{A}$ and $\vec{b}$ are overdetermined (i.e. there are more equations than there are unknowns).\\

In general, least squares involves finding the best approximate solution to these overdetermined systems.\\
    
Looking at this graphically, we can think of the problem of data-fitting. That is to say that we have many samples, and we want to draw a straight line that goes as close to each point as possible.\\

Looking at the plot below, setup a system of linear equations describing a line going through each point.\\

\begin{tikzpicture}[>=latex]
\begin{axis}[

\ans{
    Recall that the generalized equation for a line is $y=mx+c$, where $m$ is the slope of the line and $c$ is a constant shift. Since we have 4 points, we have 4 equations with known ($x$,$y$) values, and unknown slope and constants ($m$ and $c$).
    
    $$6 = (1)m + c$$
    $$5 = (2)m + c$$
    $$7 = (3)m + c$$
    $$10 = (4)m + c$$
    
}

\qitem{
    Put this system of linear equations into matrix-vector form.
}

\ans{



    $\mathbf{A}$: A matrix whose rows contain coefficients for our $x_i$.
    \[\mathbf{A} = \begin{bmatrix}1&1\\2&1\\3&1\\4&1\end{bmatrix}\]
    $\vec{x}$: A vector containing the parameters that we want to be optimizing
    \[\vec{x} = \begin{bmatrix}m\\c\end{bmatrix}\]
    $\vec{b}$: A vector containing the "true" y values of our original points, which we will want our $\hat{x}$ to approximate
    \[\vec{b} = \begin{bmatrix}6\\5\\7\\10\end{bmatrix}\]

    Putting this into the standard form $\mathbf{A}\vec{x}=\vec{b}$, we get:
    
    $$\begin{bmatrix}1&1\\2&1\\3&1\\4&1\end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix}m\\c\end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}6\\5\\7\\10\end{bmatrix}$$
    
    }
    
\qitem{
    Given that $(\mathbf{A}^T\mathbf{A})^{-1} = \begin{bmatrix}0.2&-0.5\\-0.5&1.5\end{bmatrix}$, use the linear least squares technique you learned earlier on this overdetermined system to solve for a line of best fit
}

\ans{
    $$\hat{x} = (\mathbf{A}^T\mathbf{A})^{-1}\mathbf{A}^T\vec{b}$$
    $$= \begin{bmatrix}0.2&-0.5\\-0.5&1.5\end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix}1&2&3&4\\1&1&1&1\end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix}6\\5\\7\\10\end{bmatrix}$$
    $$= \begin{bmatrix}0.2&-0.5\\-0.5&1.5\end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix}77 \\ 28 \end{bmatrix}$$
    $$\hat{x} = \begin{bmatrix}1.4 \\ 3.5 \end{bmatrix}$$
    
    Thus, we see that the line of best fit has a slope of $1.4$ and a constant shift of $3.5$, and the equation of the line is $y = 1.4x + 3.5$

Gauss used Least Squares to predict where certain planets would be in their orbit. A scientist named Piazzi made 19 observations over the period of a month in regards to the orbit of Ceres (can be viewed as equations). Gauss used some of these observations. He also knew the general shape of the orbit of planets due to Kepler's laws of planetary motion. Gauss set up equations like so: $$\alpha x^2 + \beta xy + \gamma y^2 + \delta x + \epsilon y = 1$$ So, if we make observations on the positions of the planetary bodies, how can we use least squares to find the orbit of the planet?}

\ans{
The question we need to ask is: what are the variables we need to solve for? In this case, we have points in space: thus, we have values of $x$ and $y$. Using these two values, we can also easily find $x^2$, $xy$, and $y^2$. So, the unknowns in this story are the coefficients of these variables, or the "weights" of each term. Thus we can set this problem for $n$ measurements in the form of $\mathbf{A}\vec{x}=\vec{b}$:
$$\begin{bmatrix}x_1^2&x_1y_1&y_1^2&x_1&y_1\\x_2^2&x_2y_2&y_2^2&x_2&y_2\\ & & \vdots \\x_n^2&x_ny_n&y_n^2&x_n&y_n\end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix}\alpha \\ \beta \\ \gamma \\ \delta \\ \epsilon \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}1 \\ 1 \\ \vdots \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}$$

In this case, we have an overdetermined system, which  (as we've explored earlier) can be solved using least squares. Simply use the least squares formula to find the best approximation to your weights $\hat{x} = (\mathbf{A}^T\mathbf{A})^{-1}\mathbf{A}^T\vec{b}$

Then, you can plot an ellipse of best fit that models the path of the planetary body.
